<a href="https://github.com/trinker/regexr">regexr</a> is an R framework for constructing human readable regular expressions.  It aims to provide tools that enable the user to write regular expressions in a way that is similar to the ways R code is written.  The tools allow the user to (1) write in smaller, modular, named, regular expression chunks, (2) write top to bottom, rather than a single string (3) comment idividual chunks, (4) indent expressions to represent regular expression groups, and (5) test the validity of the concatenated expression and the modular chunks.</p>
