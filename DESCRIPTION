Description: An R framework for constructing human readable regular
    expressions.  It aims to provide tools that enable the user to write
    regular expressions in a way that is similar to the ways R code is written.
    The tools allow the user to (1) write in smaller, modular, named, regular
    expression chunks, (2) write top to bottom, rather than a single string (3)
    comment individual chunks, (4) indent expressions to represent regular
    expression groups, (5) Add vertical line spaces and R comments (i.e., #),
    and (6) test the validity of the concatenated expression and the modular
    chunks.
