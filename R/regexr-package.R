#' regexr: Regular Expression Removal, Extraction, & Replacement Tools for the \pkg{qdap} Package
#'
#' \pkg{regexr} is a collection of  regular expression tools associated with 
#' the \pkg{qdap} package that may be useful outside of the context of discourse
#' analysis.  Tools include removal/extraction/replacement of abbreviations, 
#' dates, dollar amounts, email addresses, hash tags, numbers, percentages, 
#' person tags, phone numbers, times, and zip codes.
#' 
#' The \pkg{regexr} package does not aim to compete with string manipulation 
#' packages such as 
#' \href{http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stringr/index.html}{\pkg{stringr}} 
#' or \href{http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stringi/index.html}{\pkg{stringi}} 
#' but is meant to provide access to canned, common regular expression patterns 
#' that can be used within \pkg{regexr}, with \pkg{R}'s own regular 
#' expression functions, or add on string manipulation packages such as 
#' \code{stringr} and \code{stringi}.
