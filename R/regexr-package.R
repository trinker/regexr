#' regexr: Tools for Human Readable Regular Expressions
#'
#' \pkg{regexr} is an R framework for constructing human readable regular 
#' expressions.  It aims to provide tools that enable the user to write regular 
#' expressions in a way that is similar to the ways R code is written.  
#' The tools allow the user to (1) write in smaller, modular, named, regular 
#' expression chunks, (2) write top to bottom, rather than a single string (3) 
#' comment individual chunks, (4) indent expressions to represent regular 
#' expression groups, and (5) test the validity of the concatenated expression 
#' and the modular chunks. \cr \cr
#' This framework harnesses the power and flexibility of regular expressions 
#' but provides a structural frame that is more consistent with both coding 
#' writing and natural language conventions.
